## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com/new
2. **Create repository**: `axf-deployment` (or any name you prefer)
3. **Make it public** (required for Koyeb free tier)
4. **Don't initialize** with README (we already have files)

### Step 2: Upload Your Code

**Option A: GitHub Web Interface**
1. Click "uploading an existing file"
2. Drag and drop the entire `axf-deployment` folder
3. Commit with message: "Initial AXF deployment package"

**Option B: Git Command Line** (if Git is installed)
```bash
cd C:\Users\mist24lk\Downloads\Axie\axf-deployment
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial AXF deployment package"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/axf-deployment.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Deploy on Koyeb

1. **Go to Koyeb**: https://app.koyeb.com/
2. **Sign up/Login** (free tier available)
3. **Click "Create App"**
4. **Choose "GitHub"** as source
5. **Connect your GitHub account**
6. **Select your repository**: `yourusername/axf-deployment`

### Step 4: Configure Build Settings

**Build Configuration:**
- **Build command**: 
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt && cd backend-base && pip install -e . && cd ../axf && pip install -e .
  ```
- **Run command**: 
  ```
  python -m axf serve SIMPLIFIED.json --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
  ```
- **Port**: `8000`

### Step 5: Set Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in Koyeb:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

AXIESTUDIO_API_KEY=your-secret-key

PYTHONPATH=/app/backend-base
```

### Step 6: Deploy!

1. **Click "Deploy"**
2. **Wait for build** (5-10 minutes)
3. **Get your URL**: `https://your-app-name.koyeb.app`

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, test your API:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-app-name.koyeb.app/health

# Test your flow
curl -X POST https://your-app-name.koyeb.app/flows/43168b4c-a403-5990-a2c4-86bd37e04b88/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-api-key: your-secret-key" \
  -d '{"input_value": "Hello, how are you today?"}'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "result": "Hello! I'm just a computer program, so I don't have feelings, but I'm here and ready to help you. How can I assist you today?",
  "status": "success"
}
```

## ✅ Success Confirmation

Your deployment includes:

- ✅ **AXF fully functional** - All dependencies installed and working
- ✅ **OpenAI integration** - Tested with your API key, gets real AI responses
- ✅ **Flow execution** - SIMPLIFIED.json flow works perfectly
- ✅ **API server** - Serves flows as REST endpoints
- ✅ **Production ready** - Containerized and scalable

## 🎉 You're Done!
